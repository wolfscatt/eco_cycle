# EcoCycle

Our **Samsun Google Developer Students Club's** project.

This project was prepared for the **Solution Challenge 2024**.

## Project Subject
- Raising awareness of users on climate change.
- When they take photos of their work and upload them to the app, they earn a certain amount of points, which they can donate.
- Users will not only earn points for each eco-friendly task they perform, but also raise awareness.
- And users will be able to use the points they earn by donating them to environmentally friendly foundations. Thus, we will create a cycle for nature.

## Features
- Registration and login screens are available for the application.
- There is a screen where logged in users can view and modify their profile information.
- There is a screen where they can upload photos into the application.
- There is a shop display.
- And on the home page there is a screen where they can see the photos they have uploaded.
